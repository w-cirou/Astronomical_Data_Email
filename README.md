This application is made for astronomers who want daily emails about useful astronomical data for observing the night sky. At a time that the user chooses they will be sent a daily email containing useful data about the current, previous, and next moon phases, when the moon will be visible, when the planets will be visible, and the rise and set times of the sun, and the UV level for that day as well as various other statistics. This is facilitated through an event-driven architecture using four Lambda Functions written in Java 17 with various integrations. Firstly, an EventBridge rule is set up with a cron job to asynchronously invoke the ScheduledUpdateTableFunction at a specific time everyday. Next, the ScheduledUpdateTableFunction scrapes the necessary up-to-date data from various websites (URLs included in code), updates the AstronomicalDataTable, and then pushes a message to the TableHasBeenUpdatedTopic that the table has been updated. The PatchTableFunction does the same thing but is set up to be invoked manually via a HTTP PATCH request from the AstromicalDataAPI. The SendUpdateEmailFunction polls the TableHasBeenUpdatedTopic and whenever a updated table message is published, it scans the AstonomicalDataTable and send the emails to the user. Finally, the GetItemFunction provides the functionality to send a HTTP GET to get a specific item from the AstronomicalDataTable.
